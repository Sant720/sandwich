# How I would improve this project

This sandwich project is intentionally scoped and complete as it stands today. However, during development, I identified several opportunities that could expand the depth, polish, and utility of the knowledge base if I was to allocate additional time.

The following are improvements and extensions I have considered, but chose not to pursue at this stage, as the current version already meets the intended goals.

---

## Troubleshooting section

A dedicated troubleshooting page could address issues such as:

- “My sandwich is mushy.”  
  Guidance on moisture control, drying ingredients, toasting strategies, and waterproofing techniques.

- “My ingredients slip out of the sandwich.”  
  Tips related to layering order, crumb removal, structural friction, and compression.

This would serve users who run into common execution problems and want practical fixes.

## Real-life images

Including photographs of:

- The ingredients  
- Bread preparation steps  
- Intermediate stages of assembly  
- The final sandwich  

This would make the guide more visually intuitive and beginner-friendly.

---

## Tutorial videos and gifs

Short-form videos or gifs could bring the assembly steps to life. Examples include:

- Hollowing the ciabatta  
- Shingling turkey slices  
- Aligning kimchi with the bread trench  
- Pressing and wrapping the final sandwich  

A full step-by-step assembly video would be especially valuable for visual learners.

## Recommended ingredients and sourcing

A small section listing recommended brands and where to buy them could improve accessibility.  
Examples might include:

- Specific kimchi brands  
- Preferred types of turkey  
- Suggested ciabatta sources  
- Salt or herb recommendations  

This could help readers achieve results closer to the reference sandwich.

## Expanding “core principles” into its own category

While currently presented as a single page, the “core principles” section contains enough material to evolve into a full category. Potential sub-pages could include:

- Bread behavior and treatment  
- Flavor contrast theory  
- Texture interaction and bite architecture  
- Moisture dynamics  
- Structural mechanics in sandwiches  

This expansion would allow for deeper exploration without overwhelming a single page.

## Ingredient preparation guides

Future additions could include standalone tutorials for preparing or making certain ingredients, such as:

- Homemade kimchi  
- Homemade Dijonnaise  
- Roasting and slicing turkey breast  
- Selecting and storing fresh herbs  
- Proper techniques for slicing and preparing avocado
- What do to with extra bread crumb

These guides would help users build every component from scratch if they choose to.

## Closing note

These ideas reflect potential future directions rather than current commitments. In its present form, this project will remain intentionally concise, polished, and complete.
