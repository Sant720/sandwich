# AI disclosure

This project was created with **AI-assisted tooling**.  

While artificial intelligence played a supporting role, every piece of content, design choice, and code implementation was **personally reviewed, edited, and validated** to ensure accuracy, coherence, and alignment with the project's standards.

---

## Why disclose this?

This disclosure is included for **transparency**, **ethics**, and **accountability**.  

It clarifies how AI contributed to the project while affirming that the final result reflects **intentional, human-led decision-making**.

If you have questions about how specific sections were developed, feel free to explore the project’s structure or [reach out directly](/).

## How AI was used

### Content development  
I used **ChatGPT 5.1** to assist with:

- Drafting and refining conceptual explanations  
- Generating examples, variations, and reference language  
- Ensuring consistency across the knowledge base  

**All AI-generated content was manually reviewed, edited, and shaped** to fit the project's voice, constraints, and quality expectations.

### Image creation  
Visual assets were created using **Gemini Nano Banana 3 Pro** to save time in development. 

### Coding assistance  
I used **OpenAI Codex** in Visual Studio Code to assist with:

- Generating boilerplate structures  
- Speeding up repetitive or mechanical coding tasks  

All code was **reviewed, tested, and adapted manually** to ensure functional correctness and maintainability.

## Human oversight and authorship

Although AI tools contributed to portions of the work, **authorship remains human-driven**:

- I reviewed, edited, or directly created 100% of the content.  
- AI outputs were treated as *drafts*, not final deliverables.  
- No content or code was accepted without manual refinement and verification.  
- The conceptual direction, structure, and design of the project were guided entirely by me.
