# AI disclosure

Artificial intelligence played a **supporting role** in the development of this project. 

However: 

- I reviewed, edited, or directly created 100% of the content.  
- AI outputs were treated as *drafts*, not final deliverables.  
- No AI-generated content or code was accepted without manual refinement and verification.  
- The conceptual direction, structure, and design of the project are intentional and based on my professional experience.

## Why disclose this?

This disclosure is included for **transparency**, **ethics**, and **accountability**.  

It clarifies how AI contributed to the project while affirming that the final result reflects **intentional, human-led decision-making**.

If you have questions about how specific sections were developed, feel free to explore the project’s structure or [reach out directly](/).

## How AI was used

### Content development  
I used **ChatGPT 5.1** to assist with:

- Drafting and refining conceptual explanations.  
- Generating examples, variations, and reference language.  
- Ensuring consistency across the knowledge base.  

**All AI-generated content was manually reviewed, edited, and shaped** to fit the project's voice, constraints, and quality expectations.

### Image creation  
Visual assets were created using **Gemini Nano Banana 3 Pro**. 

### Coding assistance  
I used **OpenAI Codex** in Visual Studio Code to assist with:

- Generating boilerplate structures.  
- Speeding up repetitive or mechanical coding tasks.  
- Troubleshooting build and deployment errors. 

All code was **reviewed, tested, and adapted manually** to ensure functional correctness and maintainability.
