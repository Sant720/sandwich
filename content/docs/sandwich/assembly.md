# Assembly guide

The goal of assembly is to build **my favorite sandwich, The Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich**, in a way that balances flavor and ensures structural stability.

This guide follows a step-by-step workflow using the principles from  
[core principles](/docs/sandwich/core-principles/).

1. ## Prepare the bread  
   - Slice the ciabatta horizontally.  
   - Toast or griddle the cut surfaces.  
   - Hollow out a small amount from the top half to form a trough.

   This step increases moisture resistance and improves overall stability.

2. ## Add the avocado  
   - Spread lightly mashed, salted avocado on the **bottom slice**.  
   - Flatten gently to create a grippy base layer.  

3. ## Layer the turkey  
   - Shingle the turkey slices evenly across the avocado.  
   - Ensure even coverage without gaps to prevent sliding.  

4. ## Add the kimchi  
   - Place kimchi evenly over the turkey.  
   - If very juicy, blot lightly with a paper towel.  

5. ## Add optional components  
   - Thin radish slices  
   - Fresh herbs  
   - A thin layer of Dijonnaise on the **top slice**  

6. ## Close the sandwich  
   - Place the top slice over the fillings.  
   - Press gently with your palm to compact the sandwich.  
   - Slice diagonally for better structural integrity.
