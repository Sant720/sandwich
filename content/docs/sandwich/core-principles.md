# Core principles

Great sandwiches rely on three foundational concepts:

1. **Bread treatment**  
2. **Flavor and texture contrast**  
3. **Structural integrity through thoughtful layering**

These principles form the basis for **my favorite sandwich, The Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich**, and help explain why its components work together so well.

You can see how these principles are applied in the  
[Components used in my sandwich](/docs/sandwich/components/)  
and in the final preparation instructions in  
[How to make the Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich](/docs/sandwich/how-to-make/).

## Bread treatment

Bread affects structure, texture, and moisture control. A well-designed sandwich keeps bread to roughly **one-quarter** of the total volume.

Balancing bread volume ensures the filling stands out while maintaining structural stability.

### Hollowing the interior

For breads like ciabatta, baguette, or bagels, removing some interior:
- Prevents an overly bready sandwich  
- Creates a trough for fillings  
- Reduces slippage and compression issues  

### Toasting and griddling

Each method changes the bread’s behavior:

- **Toasting** dries the surface and increases resistance to moisture.  
- **Griddling** adds richness and crispness while keeping the interior tender.  
- **Fresh bread** works well when naturally structured and not overly soft.

## Flavor and texture contrast

A great sandwich balances multiple flavor and texture elements.

### Texture contrast

Aim for combinations like:
- Crisp ↔ tender  
- Juicy ↔ dry  
- Rich ↔ lean  

### Flavor contrast

Ideal sandwiches blend:
- Savory  
- Acidic  
- Spicy  
- Rich  
- Fresh

**In my sandwich:**  
Turkey provides tenderness and lean flavor, avocado adds richness, and kimchi contributes juiciness, heat, and acidity.

### Seasoning raw ingredients

Enhance raw items (e.g., tomatoes, avocado) with:
- A pinch of salt  
- A touch of acid  
- Optional flavor boosters like capers, pickle brine, or herbs

## Structural integrity

A sandwich should stay intact from first bite to last.

Techniques for maintaining structure:

- **Drain wet ingredients** (e.g., tomatoes, kimchi)  
- **Place grippy components** (avocado, herbs, radishes) between slippery ones  
- **Apply gentle pressure** before cutting to solidify layers  
- **Wrap when transporting** to prevent shifting  

{{% hint warning %}}
Ignoring moisture control often leads to bread collapse or ingredient slippage.
