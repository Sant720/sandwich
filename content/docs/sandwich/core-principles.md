# Core principles

Great sandwiches rely on three essential concepts:

1. **Bread treatment**  
2. **Flavor and texture contrast**  
3. **Structural integrity through thoughtful assembly**

These principles guide the creation of **my favorite sandwich, The Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich**, and are applied directly in the  
[components](/docs/sandwich/components/)  
and  
[assembly guide](/docs/sandwich/assembly/)  
pages.

## Bread treatment

Bread provides both structure and texture. For most sandwiches, it should make up **about one-quarter** of the total volume.

**Why this matters:**  
Too much bread overwhelms the filling. Too little bread leads to unstable construction.

### Hollowing the interior
For breads like baguette or ciabatta, removing some interior:

- Prevents an overly bready sandwich  
- Creates a **trough** for fillings  
- Reduces slippage  

### Toasting vs. griddling
- **Toasting** dries and browns the surface, helping it absorb moisture without collapsing.  
- **Griddling** adds richness and creates a crisp exterior with minimal drying.  
- **Fresh bread** works well if naturally soft and structured.

## Flavor and texture contrast

Balanced sandwiches combine different flavors and textures:

### Texture elements
- Crisp  
- Juicy  
- Tender  
- Rich  
- Chewy  

### Flavor elements
- Acidic  
- Pungent  
- Savory  
- Sweet  
- Rich

**Example from my sandwich:**  
Turkey (tender, lean) + avocado (rich, creamy) + kimchi (juicy, acidic, spicy).

## Structural integrity

A sandwich should stay intact throughout eating.

Key techniques:

- Drain wet ingredients  
- Use grippy components (lettuce, avocado, herbs) between slippery ones  
- Press lightly before cutting  
- Wrap when transporting  

You’ll see these same principles applied directly in the  
[assembly guide](/docs/sandwich/assembly/).
