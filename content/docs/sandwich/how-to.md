# How to make the Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich

This page provides the **complete, step-by-step procedure** for assembling the **Crunchy Kimchi Turkey (CKT) Sandwich**. It builds directly on the conceptual foundation established in:

- [Get started](/docs/sandwich/overview/)  
- [Core principles](/docs/sandwich/core-principles/)  
- [Ingredients](/docs/sandwich/ingredients/)  

If you have not reviewed these sections, we recommend doing so first to understand *why* each choice in this recipe works.

> [!warning]
> This page is **procedural, not conceptual**. It assumes you already understand the principles of bread treatment, flavor contrast, and structural integrity from the previous pages.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, gather the tools and materials needed to prepare the sandwich.

### Tools

- Cutting board  
- Bread knife  
- Spoon, butter knife, or small spatula  
- Oven or toaster (optional, for toasting)  
- Skillet (optional, for griddling)  
- Paper towels (optional, for blotting wet ingredients)  
- Parchment paper (optional, for resting or transport)  

### Prep time

10–15 minutes

---

## Ingredients (1 sandwich)

- 1 small **ciabatta** roll.  
- ½ medium **avocado**, sliced or mashed.   
- 3–4 slices **roast turkey**. 
- 2–4 tbsp **kimchi**, drained if very wet.
- Salt and pepper to taste. 
- Optional enhancers:
  - 1 tbsp **Dijonnaise**.  
  - 2–3 thin **radish slices**.  
  - Small handful of fresh **herbs** (e.g., cilantro, parsley, green onion).

> Each ingredient is chosen based on contrast, structural behavior, and flavor synergy. See [Ingredients](/docs/sandwich/ingredients/) for a full breakdown of why each component works.

## Steps

{{% steps %}}

1. ### Prepare the ciabatta  
   - Slice the ciabatta roll horizontally.  
   - Toast or griddle the cut sides until crisp.  
   - Remove a small amount of interior crumb from **both halfs** to create a trench.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Toasting or griddling improves moisture resistance, and hollowing creates space for fillings while reducing slippage. To learn more, see [Bread treatment](/docs/sandwich/core-principles/#bread-treatment).

2. ### Build the avocado base  
   - Spread sliced or mashed avocado onto the **bottom half** of the bread.  
   - Place carefully within the **trench** of the interior crumb. 
   - Salt lightly to enhance flavor and flatten into an even layer.

   > [!TIP]
   > Avocado acts as a rich, grippy foundation. Its slight tackiness **from within the crumb trench** will help secure the turkey and prevent spillage.

3. ### Layer the turkey  
   - Shingle the turkey slices evenly over the avocado.  
   - Use larger, flatter slices on the bottom and fold smaller pieces on top for cohesion.  
   - Avoid uneven stacking. Consistent bite thickness improves structure and mouthfeel.

4. ### Add the kimchi  
   - Mix the kimchi in its container to even the juiciness and flavors. 
   - If the kimchi is overly juicy, drain or blot lightly with a paper towel.
   - Distribute kimchi evenly over the turkey, ensuring it aligns with the trench in the top slice.

   > [!WARNING]
   > Excess moisture affects bread structure. If your kimchi is very wet, consider using Dijonnaise on the top slice as a moisture buffer.

5. ### Add optional enhancers  
   - **Radish** adds sharp crunch.  
   - **Fresh herbs** add brightness and aroma.  
   - **Dijonnaise** adds tangy richness—spread it on the **top half** for best distribution.

   > [!info]
   > Learn more about these enhancers in [Ingredients](/docs/sandwich/ingredients/) or explore more options in [Contrast](/docs/sandwich/core-principles/#contrast). 


6. ### Close, press, and cut  
   - Place the top half of the ciabatta onto the fillings.  
   - Apply gentle downward pressure to unify the layers and improve cohesion.  
   - Slice diagonally for better structural integrity and presentation.

   > [!INFO]
   > Pressing helps bind the layers and reduces the risk of slippage, especially when working with juicy or high-texture ingredients like kimchi.


7. ### Serve and enjoy  
   - This sandwich is best enjoyed immediately after preparation. 
   - For preservation tips, see [Storage and transportation](/docs/sandwich/how-to/#storage-and-transportation).

## Storage and transportation

- **For optimal cohesion before transportation**, wrap the sandwich in parchment or plastic foil and **press for 10-20 minutes**. 
- **For storing**, tightly wrap the sandwich, press for 10-20 minutes, and refrigerate in an air-tight container. This will help preserve texture and prevent moisture migration.  
- **See [Moisture](/docs/sandwich/core-principles/#moisture)** to prevent issues with structural stability.
