## Ingredients (1 sandwich)

- 1 small **ciabatta** roll  
- ½ medium **avocado**, lightly mashed  
- 3–4 slices **roast turkey**

## Steps

{{% steps %}}

1. ## Prepare the ciabatta  
   - Slice the ciabatta roll horizontally.  
   - Lightly toast or griddle the cut surfaces until crisp.  
   - Hollow out a small amount from the **top half** to create a trough.

   Toasting improves moisture resistance. Hollowing creates space for fillings and prevents slippage.

2. ## Add the avocado  
   - Spread the mashed avocado evenly over the **bottom slice**.  
   - Salt lightly and flatten for an even base.

   Avocado acts as a rich, grippy foundation that prevents ingredients from sliding.

3. ## Layer the turkey  
   - Shingle the roast turkey slices evenly across the avocado.  
   - Avoid overstacking—thin, even layers improve bite consistency.  

4. ## Add the kimchi  
   - Scatter drained kimchi evenly over the turkey.  
   - Blot lightly if overly juicy.

   Excess moisture from kimchi can affect bread structure.  
   If using very juicy kimchi, consider spreading a thin layer of Dijonnaise on the top slice to waterproof it.

5. ## Add optional enhancements  
   - Radish slices add peppery crunch.  
   - Fresh herbs add brightness.  
   - Dijonnaise boosts richness and acidity—spread it on the **top slice** if using.  

6. ## Close, press, and cut  
   - Place the top slice over the fillings.  
   - Press gently with your palm to compact.  
   - Slice diagonally for better structure and presentation.

   Pressing helps unify the layers, especially when using ingredients like kimchi that have texture and moisture.

## Serving notes

{{% hint success %}}
For maximum cohesion and flavor, wrap the sandwich in parchment and let it rest for **10–15 minutes** before eating.  
This mirrors the “pressing” technique used in sandwiches like pan bagnat.

Best enjoyed immediately after preparation; can be refrigerated for up to 2 hours if wrapped tightly.
