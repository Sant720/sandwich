## History of the Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich

The Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich began as an attempt to improve a basic, everyday turkey sandwich. I used to rely on simple turkey on bread because it was fast to assemble, but the result was rarely memorable. It often tasted dry, mild, and incomplete.

The turning point came when I started exploring techniques centered on flavor contrast, texture balance, and bread treatment. Around the same time, I had a jar of kimchi in the refrigerator and a leftover toasted ciabatta roll. Out of convenience more than creativity, I added a small spoonful of kimchi to a turkey and avocado sandwich. The improvement was immediate and surprisingly effective.

- The **turkey** provided structure and protein.  
- The **avocado** added creaminess and richness.  
- The **kimchi** brought brightness, acidity, spice, and crispness.  
- The **ciabatta** created a sturdy, toasted base that kept everything in place.

After that moment, the combination stuck. I refined the sandwich gradually by adjusting the bread preparation, balancing moisture, and testing optional additions like radish or Dijonnaise. What began as a convenient experiment slowly developed into a reliable, well-balanced meal.

Today, the Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich represents the result of those small discoveries. It is both a personal favorite and a practical example of how thoughtful technique can elevate simple ingredients into something layered, flavorful, and structurally sound.
