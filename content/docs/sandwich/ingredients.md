# Ingredients

The **Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich** requires only four main ingredients. Put together, they create a sandwich that has **contrast, structure, and balance**. These are the pillars of a great sandwich, as seen in [Core principles of sandwich-making](/docs/sandwich/core-principles/).

> [!warning]
> This page provides a **conceptual overview** of each ingredient and why they work with each other. For step-by-step assembly, see [How to make the Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich](/docs/sandwich/how-to/).

## Bread: Toasted ciabatta

Toasted ciabatta provides the structural foundation of the sandwich. Its naturally airy crumb makes it easy to hollow for better filling containment, while its crust becomes crisp and sturdy when toasted. This balance of **chew, crispness, and internal space** supports juicy ingredients like kimchi without overwhelming the bite.

## Main filling: Sliced roast turkey

Turkey serves as the **primary savory and structural component**. Its lean, mild profile gives the sandwich stability without adding heaviness, making it an ideal base for stronger flavors such as kimchi or dijonnaise. The tenderness of turkey also complements crisp and acidic elements, supporting both flavor and texture contrast.

## Rich element: Avocado

Avocado contributes the sandwich’s **rich, creamy dimension**, balancing the lean turkey and sharp acidity from kimchi. Its natural density and slight tackiness act as a **structural anchor**, helping ingredients stay in place during assembly and eating. Avocado also enhances mouthfeel by adding smoothness between crisp layers.

## Flavor contrast: Kimchi

Kimchi is the sandwich’s primary driver of **flavor contrast**. It brings:

- Bright acidity  
- Gentle heat  
- Juiciness  
- Light crunch  
- Pungency and fermented depth  

These qualities lift the mild turkey and bring vibrancy to each bite, preventing flatness and adding progression to the flavor profile.

## Optional enhancers

These additions allow you to customize the sandwich while maintaining its core principles:

- **Dijonnaise** – adds tangy richness and amplifies savory components  
- **Radish** – introduces sharp, peppery crunch for extra textural contrast  
- **Fresh herbs** – provide aromatic brightness and a fresh top note  

Each optional component should serve a purpose aligned with the sandwich’s flavor and texture structure.
