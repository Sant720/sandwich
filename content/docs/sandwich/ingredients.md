# Ingredients

This section introduces the ingredients used in **my favorite sandwich, The Crunchy Kimchi Turkey Sandwich**, and explains why each one was intentionally chosen based on the [core principles](/docs/sandwich/core-principles/).

---

## Bread: Toasted ciabatta

Chosen because:

- Light, airy interior (easy to hollow)  
- Crisp crust after toasting  
- Excellent structure without overwhelming the fillings

## Main filling: Sliced roast turkey

- Lean protein base  
- Mild flavor that pairs well with acidity and heat  
- Provides structure to the overall bite

---

## Rich element: Avocado

Serves as:

- A creamy, rich counterbalance to lean turkey  
- An edible “glue” that helps prevent sliding  
- A naturally grippy bottom layer

---

## Flavor contrast: Kimchi

Adds:

- Juiciness  
- Heat  
- Acidity  
- Crunch  

Kimchi brings brightness and complexity to an otherwise mild filling.

## Optional enhancers

These optional components let you personalize the final recipe:

- **Dijonnaise** (tangy and rich)  
- **Radish** (peppery crunch)  
- **Fresh herbs** (brightness, aroma)
